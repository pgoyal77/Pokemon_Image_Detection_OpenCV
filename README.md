# Pokemon Image Classifier â€“ CNN Based

This project is a based on deep learning experiment, I focused on classifying images of **three popular Pokemon**: **Pikachu**, **Meowth**, and **Bulbasaur**, using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. Built using Python and TensorFlow, it demonstrates how image recognition techniques can be applied to custom Image datasets.

## Dataset Details

The dataset contains labeled images of:
- Pikachu
- Meowth
- Bulbasaur

Each category includes a set of training and testing images.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- OpenCV  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Features

- Image loading and preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
- CNN model building with Keras Sequential API
- Training with categorical cross-entropy
- Validation on test images
- Confusion matrix visualization
